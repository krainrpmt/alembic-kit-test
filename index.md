## Briefly About Me


My name is Krai Naruepornmatee, a mechanical engineering graduate from the [Department of Mechanical Engineering], [Faculty of Engineering], [Chulalongkorn University] and the recipient of [Anandamahidol Scholarship] 2025, a fully funded scholarship for outstanding young Thai students to pursue graduate studies abroad in each of eight fields of studies, including engineering, medicine, science, social sciences, arts and humanities, agriculture, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.

I am extremely passion for Aerospace Propulsion particularly those related to *turbomachinery* and *combustion*. My currently most interested research is in *"the design of supersonic turbine for rotating detonation engine"* and those related to rocket engine turbopump and gas turbine development.
